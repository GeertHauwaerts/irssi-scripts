## About

My Irssi scripts collection.


## Installation

The installation of an Irssi script is very easy and straightforward:

  * Copy the script into your `~/.irssi/scripts/` directory.
  * Load the script with the `SCRIPT LOAD script.pl` command.

You can load the script automatically by placing it in the
`~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/` directory.


## Files

  * The `src/` directory:
    * `active_notice.pl`
      * This script shows incoming notices into the active channel.
    * `away_hilight_notice.pl`
      * This script will notice your away message in response to a hilight.
  * `LICENSE`
    * The license of the scripts.
  * `README.md`
    * The file you are reading at this very moment.


## Collaboration

The GitHub repository is used to keep track of all the bugs and feature
requests; I prefer to work uniquely via GitHib, IRC and Twitter.

If you have a patch to contribute:

  * Fork this repository on GitHub.
  * Create a feature branch for your set of patches.
  * Commit your changes to Git and push them to GitHub.
  * Submit a pull request.

Shout to [@GeertHauwaerts](https://twitter.com/GeertHauwaerts) on Twitter at
